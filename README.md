# MLOps & Marketing Attribution Optimization

This project focuses on implementing **MLOps** strategies and optimizing **Marketing Attribution** using machine learning pipelines. It demonstrates how to use cloud platforms, automated workflows, and monitoring tools to enhance the accuracy of machine learning models and optimize data-driven decision-making for marketing.

## Features

- **Build and Deploy ML Pipelines**: Utilize **Azure** tools (Databricks, Synapse, Azure Functions) to build and deploy scalable machine learning pipelines.
- **Automated Model Retraining**: Implement workflows for continuous retraining of models to ensure they stay optimized over time.
- **Performance Monitoring & Anomaly Detection**: Integrate monitoring tools to track model performance and detect anomalies.
- **Marketing Attribution Optimization**: Apply marketing measurement strategies to optimize decision-making through data analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure** (Databricks, Synapse, Azure Functions)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- **FastAPI** for API development
- **Matplotlib** for plotting data visualizations
- **Numpy** for numerical computations
- **Docker** for containerizing the application
- **CI/CD Tools**: Jenkins, Azure Pipelines for automated deployment
